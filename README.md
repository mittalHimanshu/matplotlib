## Project Statement

A photographer friend of mine, Steve, was commissioned to take pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. For those not familiar with Old Faithful, it is a cone geyser in Yellowstone with a predictable geothermal eruption. Steve hopes to take some amazing pictures for his client. He will be taking both still pictures and video. He would like to know the bestopportunities for taking still photos or short videos of a single eruption. I've discovered some data about Old Faithful's eruption events. It provides both the eruption time and wait time between eruptions in minutes for 272 observed eruptions.
